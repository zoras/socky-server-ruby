# Socky - server in Ruby [![](http://travis-ci.org/socky/socky-server-ruby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/socky/socky-server-ruby)

## Installation

``` bash
$ gem install socky-server --pre
```

## Usage

Socky server provides two Rack middlewares - WebSocket and HTTP. Each one of them can be used separately, but they can be also used in one process. Example Rackup file could look like that:

``` ruby
require 'socky/server'

map '/websocket' do
  run Socky::Server::WebSocket.new
end

map '/http' do
  run Socky::Server::HTTP.new
end
```

## Configuration

Both middlewares accept options as hash. Currently available options are:

### :applications [Hash]

Hash of supported applications. Each key is application name, each value is application secret. You can use as much applications as you want - each of them will have separate application address created by mixing hostname, middleware address and application name. So i.e. for app "my_app" WebSocket application uri will be:

```
http://example.org/websocket/my_app
```

### :debug [Boolean]

Should application log output? Default Rack logger will be used, so demonized server will log to file. Please note that for HTTP middlewere Rack::CommonLogger will be more reliable that debug mode.

### :config [String]

Path to YAML config file. Config file should contain hash with exactly the same syntax like normal options.

## Example configuration

Create file 'config.ru':

``` ruby
require 'socky/server'

options = {
  :debug => true,
  :applications => {
    :my_app => 'my_secret',
    :other_app => 'other_secret'
  }
}

map '/websocket' do
  run Socky::Server::WebSocket.new options
end

map '/http' do
  use Rack::CommonLogger
  run Socky::Server::HTTP.new options
end
```

Run file using Thin:

``` bash
$ thin -R config.ru -p3001 start
```

## Setting other options

Options like demonizing, logging to file, SSL support and others should be supported by Rack server like Thin. Socky Server is utilizing all of them so we will not describe them here.

## Which Rack servers are currently supported?

All that are supported by [websocket-rack](http://github.com/imanel/websocket-rack). At the time of writing only Thin was supported, but it should change in near future.
